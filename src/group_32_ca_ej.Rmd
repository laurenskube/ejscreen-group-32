ces <- read_csv(here("data", "ces3demographics.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = ces, aes(x = white_percent, y = ces_3_0_score)) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(x = "% White Population", 
       y = "CalEnviroScreen 3.0 Score", 
       title = "Percentage White Population vs. CalEnviroScreen Pollution Burden") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "navy", high = "orange") +
  theme_minimal()
```
As the percent of the population that is white increases, the CalEnviroScreen pollution burden scores tend to decrease, which represents a negative relationship between the two variables. This suggests that communities that are predominantly white bear less of the pollution burden as compared with communities that are less white.
